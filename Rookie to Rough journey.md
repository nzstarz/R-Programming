# R-Programming
Programming basics for Data Science


To Learn R, I have been Following the course ‘R Programming by Jhon Hopkins Univerversity’ from Coursera. A simple 4 week course along with practices through swirl on R studio. That kills some time but worth it.


## Week 1

	- Installation Guideline 
	- Overview & Background of R
	- How One must Seek Help

	- Data Types -R Objects and Attributes
	- Data types - Vector & Lists
	- Data Types - Matrices
	- Data Types - Factors
	- Data Types - Missing Values
	- Data Types - Data Frames
	- Data Types - Names attribute
	- Data Types - Summary
	- Reading Tabular Data
	- Reading Large Tables
	- Textual Data Formats
	- Connections: Interfaces to the Outside World
	- Subsetting - Basics
	- Subsetting - Lists
	- Subsetting - Matrices
	- Subsetting - Partial Matching
	- Subsetting - Removing Missing Values
	- Vectorized Operations
